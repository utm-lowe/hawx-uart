    // 1. Check if the PORT_CONSOLEOUT port has any characters in it.
    //    If it does not, return immediately. (NOTE: You want to do this
    //    by looking at the "count" field in port. DO NOT read the character
    //    yet as you may not be sending this character.)
    // 2. Check if the UART transmit holding register is full. If it is,
    //    return immediately. The UART will interrupt when it is ready for
    //    a new byte.
    // 3. Read the next character from the PORT_CONSOLEOUT port using 
    //    port_read.
    // 4. Send the character out the UART by writing it to the THR register.

  // pressed, these should be translated into newline (\n) characters
  // in order to work as expected.
